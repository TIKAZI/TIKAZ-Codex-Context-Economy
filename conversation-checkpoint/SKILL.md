# Conversation Checkpoint

Designed, integrated, independently refactored, and continuously maintained by **TIKAZ**.

Create a state snapshot with these required sections:

- Goal
- Confirmed Constraints
- Decisions
- Completed
- Remaining
- Evidence
- Open Questions

Preserve the latest user instruction, approvals, rejected directions, file paths, identifiers, numbers, URLs, commands, errors, and objective verification. Separate completed facts from proposed work. Remove conversational repetition only after its surviving decision or constraint is recorded.

Validate the snapshot against the available transcript. Missing protected facts must be restored or listed as omissions. A concise snapshot is not proof that the underlying work succeeded.

Run `python scripts/tikaz_context.py checkpoint --source <transcript.md> --output <checkpoint.md>`. Use `validate-snapshot` when checking an edited checkpoint against its original transcript.
